# Remotion Video App

This is a remotion based video app that uses React to render videos.

Full remotion docs can be found here: https://www.remotion.dev/docs/. Consult these docs often if you're uncertain.

### Project Structure

The Root file is usually named "src/Root.tsx" and looks like this:

```
import {Composition} from 'remotion';
import {MyComp} from './MyComp';

export const Root: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<Composition
				id="MyComp"
				component={MyComp}
				durationInFrames={120}
				width={1920}
				height={1080}
				fps={30}
				defaultProps={{}}
			/>
		</>
	);
};
```

A `<Composition>` defines a video that can be rendered. It consists of a React "component", an "id", a "durationInFrames", a "width", a "height" and a frame rate "fps". The default frame rate should be 30. The default height should be 1080 and the default width should be 1920. The default "id" should be "MyComp". The "defaultProps" must be in the shape of the React props the "component" expects.

Inside a React "component", one can use the "useCurrentFrame()" hook to get the current frame number. Frame numbers start at 0.

```
export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	return <div>Frame {frame}</div>;
};
```

### Component Rules

Inside a component, regular HTML and SVG tags can be returned. There are special tags for video and audio. Those special tags accept regular CSS styles.

If a video is included in the component it should use the `<OffthreadVideo>` tag.

```
import {OffthreadVideo} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<OffthreadVideo
				src="https://remotion.dev/bbb.mp4"
				style={{width: '100%'}}
			/>
		</div>
	);
};
```

OffthreadVideo has a "startFrom" prop that trims the left side of a video by a number of frames. OffthreadVideo has a "endAt" prop that limits how long a video is shown. OffthreadVideo has a "volume" prop that sets the volume of the video. It accepts values between 0 and 1.

If a non-animated image is included in the component it should use the `<Img>` tag.

```
import {Img} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <Img src="https://remotion.dev/logo.png" style={{width: '100%'}} />;
};
```

If an animated GIF is included, the "@remotion/gif" package should be installed and the `<Gif>` tag should be used.

```
import {Gif} from '@remotion/gif';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Gif
			src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYd5y8e1t0m/giphy.gif"
			style={{width: '100%'}}
		/>
	);
};
```

If audio is included, the `<Audio>` tag should be used.

```
import {Audio} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <Audio src="https://remotion.dev/audio.mp3" />;
};
```

Asset sources can be specified as either a Remote URL or an asset that is referenced from the "public/" folder of the project. If an asset is referenced from the "public/" folder, it should be specified using the "staticFile" API from Remotion

```
import {Audio, staticFile} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return <Audio src={staticFile('audio.mp3')} />;
};
```

Audio has a "startFrom" prop that trims the left side of an audio by a number of frames. Audio has a "endAt" prop that limits how long audio is shown. Audio has a "volume" prop that sets the volume of the audio. It accepts values between 0 and 1.

If two elements should be rendered on top of each other, they should be layered using the "AbsoluteFill" component from "remotion".

```
import {AbsoluteFill} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<AbsoluteFill>
			<AbsoluteFill style={{background: 'blue'}}>
				<div>This is in the back</div>
			</AbsoluteFill>
			<AbsoluteFill style={{background: 'blue'}}>
				<div>This is in front</div>
			</AbsoluteFill>
		</AbsoluteFill>
	);
};
```

Any element can be wrapped in a "Sequence" component from "remotion" to place the element later in the video.

```
import {Sequence} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Sequence from={10} durationInFrames={20}>
			<div>This only appears after 10 frames</div>
		</Sequence>
	);
};
```

A Sequence has a "from" prop that specifies the frame number where the element should appear. The "from" prop can be negative, in which case the Sequence will start immediately but cut off the first "from" frames.

A Sequence has a "durationInFrames" prop that specifies how long the element should appear.

If a child component of Sequence calls "useCurrentFrame()", the enumeration starts from the first frame the Sequence appears and starts at 0.

For displaying multiple elements after another, the "Series" component from "remotion" can be used.

```
import {Series} from 'remotion';

export const MyComp: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		<Series>
			<Series.Sequence durationInFrames={20}>
				<div>This only appears immediately</div>
			</Series.Sequence>
			<Series.Sequence durationInFrames={30}>
				<div>This only appears after 20 frames</div>
			</Series.Sequence>
		</Series>
	);
};
```

For transitions, the "TransitionSeries" component from "@remotion/transitions" can be used.

Remotion needs all of the React code to be deterministic. Therefore, it is forbidden to use the Math.random() API. Use the "random()" function from "remotion" with a static seed instead.

Remotion includes an `interpolate()` helper that can animate values over time:

```
import {interpolate} from 'remotion';

const value = interpolate(frame, [0, 100], [0, 1], {
	extrapolateLeft: 'clamp',
	extrapolateRight: 'clamp',
});
```

Remotion includes a `spring()` helper for physics-based animations:

```
import {spring} from 'remotion';

const value = spring({
	fps,
	frame,
	config: {damping: 200},
});
```

### Making UI Components

Remotion components are fundamentally different from normal interactive React components:

- Are rendered frame-by-frame to create videos
- Cannot have user interactions (no onClick, onHover, etc.)
- Cannot use hooks like useState for interactivity
- Must be deterministic — same input always produces same output
- Animations are driven by the current frame number
- Avoid useEffect — calculations should be pure based on frame
